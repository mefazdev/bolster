            Adolescents (children aged 10â€“19) grow up in a transforming world.
            Technology, migration, climate change, and conflict are reshaping

            <b>Transferable skills: </b> Also called &quot;life skills,&quot;
            &quot;twenty-first-century skills,&quot; &quot;soft skills,&quot; or
            &quot;socio-emotional skills,&quot; these allow young people to
            become agile learners and global citizens equipped to navigate
            personal, social, academic, and economic challenges. Transferable
            skills also help young people affected by crisis cope with trauma
            and build resilience. They include problem-solving, negotiation,
            managing emotions, empathy, and communication.

            The 21st century is often described as an age of uncertainty and
            ambiguity with unprecedented challenges. New technologies and
            digital media are facilitating imagination and inventiveness.
            However, there are also challenges such as rapid urbanization,
            significant disruptions in employment opportunities, and lack of
            quality education. Contrary to the pessimistic views of youth being
            unmotivated, feeling entitled, and disruptive, we need to see the
            tremendous potential in flourishing our youth. Adolescence is a
            crucial phase of life to be relished. It is a time of discovery,
            finding meaning, and developing independence. Youth everywhere seek
            relevance and the right and space to discover, fail, and be
            respected. They want their voices to be heard and desire to
            contribute. The youths are valuable people and outstanding citizens
            who bring fresh ideas, knowledge, and learning. However, they often
            lack opportunities and are given more of the same. How can we create
            more space, time, pathways, and positive learning experiences for
            them? The present camp proposes to address this concern. <br />
            Bolster Foundation understands that we need an approach
            characterized by big picture thinking, fostering imagination and
            inquiry, and building grit through social-emotional learning and
            cultivating resilience. We need to prepare adolescents with ways of
            thinking beyond analytical thinking. It implies the design of tasks
            where education has purposeful connections to the world beyond the
            classroom and provides for different needs and interests of the
            learners. We advocate the use of real-world problems. Wherein
            solving a problem, students need to get the facts of the bigger
            picture and inter-related issues before going into the analytical
            and logical reasoning.
